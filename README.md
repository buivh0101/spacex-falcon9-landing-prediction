# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project predicts whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.  
It uses launch data scraped from Wikipedia, cleaned, and analyzed through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models.

## Objectives
- Collect and clean Falcon 9 launch data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, MLP).
- Tune hyperparameters with Optuna.
- Identify important features that affect landing success.
